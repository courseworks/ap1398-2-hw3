#  Introduction
In this homework, you'll get familiar a little with **neural networks**. Also, you'll estimate some functions using them. Isn't that wonderful?! In this way, you must use the **Matrix** class implemented in the last homework by yourself. You can also change it if you think it's necessary. In the end, you must do all your codes in **Matrix**, **dataset**, **result**, **neuralnet** and **aphw3** header and cpp files.
